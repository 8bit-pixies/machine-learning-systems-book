# Introduction

Welcome to my _Machine Learning Systems Book_, which is all about well...machine learning systems!

# Who This Book Is For

This book explores generic patterns and recipes for productionising machine learning. It focuses primarily on low resources and low infrastructure setups, particularly pertaining how you might train and deploy complex machine learning systems in relatively constrained settings.

This book is my unofficial response to the "Machine Learning Design Patterns", which I personally felt focussed heavily on building machine learning systems for large enterprise teams - which unfortauntely is not always the case. Machine learning should be possible for all, not just organisations who have the capability to hire large teams. 

# How to Use This Book

In general we assume the book is read sequentially, but of course feel free to skip ahead, and jump back - whatever works for you!
