# Machine Learning Systems

Many modern machine learning systems require an enormous amount of infrastructure setup and expensive compute resources. This book aims to explore how machine learning models can be built and deployed in low resource settings, without making assumptions that a cloud provider is available, the availability of message queues or even Kubernetes. 

By reading this book, I hope it encourages readers to push the boundaries of how software applications can be written in the machine learning contexts leading to simplier deployments which hopefully leads to easier management of data pipelines and processes.

Of course this book will offer an opinionated take - though my hope is that the reader will gain new perspective and strong grounding in machine learning systems to scale to more complex frameworks.

Thank you so much for reading.
